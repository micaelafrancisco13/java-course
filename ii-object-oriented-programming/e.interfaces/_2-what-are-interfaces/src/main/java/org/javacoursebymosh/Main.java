        // includes method declarations, no implementations. It
        // defines capabilities that a class should have. It
        // cannot be instantiated.

        // Programming against an interface means that if we
        // modify class B, class A who's dependent on it, won't
        // get affected.

        // Classes - HOW it should be done

        // loosely-coupled, extensible, testable applications.
